        Failure to thrive (FTT) is a term used to describe inadequate growth or
        the inability to maintain growth, usually in early years of life. It is
        common to differentiate the factors that cause FTT into 2 main groups:
        organic (medical) and nonorganic (social or environmental). There is
        increasing recognition that in many children the cause is multifactorial
        and includes biologic, psychosocial, and environmental contributors. In
        a lot of cases mixed FTT has been diagnosed (combining both organic and
        nonOrganic causes).

        FTTell is a new software which aims to provide a comprehensive treatment
        for FTT (Failure To Thrive). Our software is unique by the ability to
        combine the treatment for all aspects that might cause FTT in fastest
        and effective way. Nowadays there is no solution that is comprehensive
        and takes into consideration the conflict between one treatment to
        another.
